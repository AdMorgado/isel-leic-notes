# isel-leic-notes üóíÔ∏è

> This repo contains some notes from the subjects of my degree in [Computer Science and Computer Engineering](https://www.isel.pt/en/curso/bsc-degree/computer-science-and-computer-engineering), at [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/).

The sole purpose of these notes is to share the knowledge and notes that I have acquired in the course.

Some notes are written in Portuguese, and some in English.

So far, there are notes for the following subjects:

* [SI - Information Systems / Sistemas de Informa√ß√£o](./si);
* [LAE - Languages and Managed Runtimes / Linguagens e Ambientes de Execu√ß√£o](./lae).
